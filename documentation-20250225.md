## Changes Made

### Scrolling Issues in the Right-Sided UI

Fixed scrolling issues in the right-sided UI by:

1. Added `overflow: hidden` to the body, html, and root App div to prevent scrolling at the document level:
   - Modified `index.html` to add `style="overflow: hidden; margin: 0; padding: 0; height: 100vh;"` to the body element
   - Modified `src/index.css` to add the same styles to html and body elements
   - Modified `src/components/App.tsx` to add `style={{ overflow: 'hidden', height: '100vh' }}` to the root App div

2. Added `overflow-auto` to the tab content area in the TranscriptTabs component:
   - Modified `src/components/TranscriptTabs.tsx` to add `overflow-auto` to the tab content div
   - Made the tab navigation sticky with `sticky top-0 z-10 bg-gray-100`
   - Added a fixed height to the tab content area with `style={{ height: 'calc(50vh - 120px)' }}`

3. Added `overflow-auto` to the TabsContent component:
   - Modified `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` to add `overflow-auto` to the TabsContent component

4. Set the right-sided container to have a maximum height and auto overflow:
   - Modified `src/components/Transcript.tsx` to add `maxHeight: '50vh', overflowY: 'auto'` to the right-sided container

### Backup Creation

Created a backup of these changes:
- Created a new branch called 'backup-20250225'
- Committed all the changes with the message "Fix scrolling issues in the right-sided UI"
- Pushed the branch to the remote repository

## Project Structure and Insights

### UI Components Structure

1. **Transcript Component**:
   - Main container with two parts: TranscriptSoap (left) and a right container
   - Left container (TranscriptSoap) takes 45% width and full height
   - Right container takes 55% width and is limited to 50vh height

2. **TranscriptSoap Component**:
   - Contains a Card with a header and content
   - The header has a title, copy and maximize buttons, and a detail toggle
   - The content area contains a TranscriptSummary component

3. **Right Container**:
   - Contains toggle buttons at the top
   - Contains the TranscriptTabs component below the toggle buttons

4. **TranscriptTabs Component**:
   - Contains a tab list at the top with tab triggers for different tabs (Consult Wizard, Orders, etc.)
   - Contains a tab content area that displays the content of the selected tab

5. **Tab Content Components**:
   - Each tab content contains components like TranscriptConsultWizard, TranscriptOrders, etc.
   - These components contain a Card with a header and content
   - The content area contains a TranscriptSummary component

6. **TranscriptSummary Component**:
   - Uses the ScrollArea component for scrolling
   - Contains a header with edit toggle and buttons
   - Contains a content area with the summary text

### Scrolling Behavior

The original issue was that when the content in a tab was longer than the container, the entire right-sided UI would scroll instead of just the content within the tab. The changes ensure that:

1. The SOAP component takes up the full height of the container
2. The right-sided container is limited to the upper half of the screen
3. Scrolling occurs only within the containers, not affecting the entire UI

### Repository Information

- Original repository: https://github.com/ericdagenais/aiwebdashboard
- Original branch: features/prompt-visualizer
- Backup branch: backup-20250225

## Future Considerations

1. The fixed positioning of the right container might cause issues on different screen sizes. Consider using a more responsive approach.
2. The ScrollArea component is used for scrolling in the TranscriptSummary component, which is a good pattern to follow for other scrollable areas.
3. The tab content area could benefit from a more explicit height definition to ensure consistent scrolling behavior.
4. Consider adding overflow indicators to show users that content is scrollable.
